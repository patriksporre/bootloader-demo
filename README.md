# bootloader-demo
This demo is a tribute to the good old days when systems booted directly from disk. The bootloader decompresses and decrypts a simple application that showcases Mode 13h graphics, featuring a classic main loop with double-buffered rendering synchronised with vertical blanking. The application is packed using RLE compression and XOR encryption.
