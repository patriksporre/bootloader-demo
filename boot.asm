; This bootloader program loads a secondary application from a specified sector on a floppy disk
; into memory and then jumps to execute it. It is designed to be minimalistic and primarily used 
; for educational purposes or as a foundation for more advanced bootloader development.
; 
; Key learnings and common pitfalls:
;
; 1. Sector addressing misalignment:
;    - BIOS uses 1-based indexing for sectors ('cl' should be '0x02' for sector 2), while the head and cylinder are 0-based
;    - Misalignment here leads to incorrect data loading or system halts
;
; 2. 'dd' command and 'seek' misalignment:
;    - For creating the floppy image with 'dd', use 'seek=1' to write to sector 2
;    - Using 'seek=2' skips to sector 3, leading to misaligned data at 0x400 instead of 0x200
;
; 3. Proper segment register setup:
;    - BIOS initializes segment registers unpredictably; set 'ds', 'es', and 'ss' to '0x0000', and 'sp' to '0x7C00'
;
; 4. Correct drive number handling:
;    - Store the boot drive number from 'dl' (provided by BIOS) to correctly access the boot disk
;
; 5. Memory addressing for application:
;    - Load the application to address '0x9000' and use a far jump ('jmp 0x0000:0x9000') to set 'cs' and 'ip' correctly
;
; 6. Debugging with visual feedback:
;    - Displaying 'L', 'J', 'E', and 'U' for "Load", "Jump", "Error", and "Unpack" helps to track the bootloaderâ€™s progress
;
; Usage:
; - Assemble this bootloader using NASM:
;     nasm -f bin boot.asm -o boot.bin
;
; - Write the assembled bootloader to the first sector of a floppy image using a script or direct dd command:
;     dd if=boot.bin of=floppy.img bs=512 count=1 conv=notrunc
;
; - This bootloader expects an application to be placed in the second sector of the floppy (offset 0x200)
;
; Example QEMU Test:
; - To test with QEMU, run:
;     qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=floppy.img,format=raw,if=floppy,index=0 -boot a
; 
; Features:
; - Initializes stack and segment registers for predictable behavior
; - Displays debug characters ('L', 'J', 'E', and 'U') for "Load," "Jump,", "Error", and "Unpack" stages
; - Loads application to memory address '0x9000'
; - Pads the boot sector to 512 bytes and includes the 0xAA55 boot signature

; Unpack - Decompresses and decrypts the loaded application data
; 
; This function performs RLE (Run-Length Encoding) decompression with XOR 
; decryption to restore the application to its original form before execution.
; The packed and encrypted data is loaded into memory at LOAD_ADDR by the 
; bootloader and is unpacked to DECODE_ADDR, ready for execution.
;
; Registers used:
;   - SI: Source pointer, initially set to LOAD_ADDR (compressed and encrypted data)
;   - DI: Destination pointer, initially set to DECODE_ADDR (decompressed data)
;   - BL: XOR key used for decryption (constant value XOR_KEY)
;   - CL: Counter for RLE decompression (number of bytes to write)
;
; Process:
;   1. Read the repetition count and byte to repeat from the compressed data
;   2. Apply XOR decryption to the byte
;   3. Write the decrypted byte to the destination address DI
;   4. Repeat until all bytes are written, or a zero repetition count signals the end
